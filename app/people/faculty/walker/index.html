                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Professor Andrew Walker has been the ITLS department head since 2014. He has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in English, but he is a self-taught statistical nerd who gets excited about objectively awesome stuff like bayesian network meta-analysis and multilevel modeling. In his off time, he likes to spend his time hardscaping his yard and hunting down ugly sweaters. Andy is famous for winning the ITLS Ugly Sweater contest every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Andrew cares about helping his students engage with learning experiences that will prepare them for what they&rsquo;ll experience in their careers. In his research, he uses approaches that allow research to happen in the real world, rather than in clinical settings. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Andrew&rsquo;s work focuses on understanding what happens in Problem-Based Learning and finding new ways of assessment and analysis with innovative meta-analysis methods. He looks for innovations for meta analysis from outside of the Learning Sciences field. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span>Much of Andrew&rsquo;s work (such as a systematic reviews) is something that people can be trained in quickly. He also likes being pushed in new directions. Some of his favorite students to work with have brought existing passions to the table, including attachment theory, interests in graduate level academic writing, or STEM. </span></p>

                                <p class="c0"><span>In this collection of readings, Dr. Walker shows his interest in the different ways people have used problem-based learning. Howard S. Barrows pioneered PBL in the 1960s when he presented his medical students with real patient problems so they could catch a vision for what medical practice would be like and have compelling reasons to learn about things like biochemistry. Now, PBL is widely used across multiple fields. By combining writings from leaders in the field, the editors compare PBL with traditional learning and examine the strength of PBL in different settings.

                                <p class="c0"><span>Geoscientists like to get out of the office and do a lot of local field trips with their students. But teaching geoscience presents specific challenges. Some places are highly restricted for the sake of preservation, or inaccessible to students with disabilities. In this project (which is also part of the Geology Commons project), Dr. Walker and his team developed three apps that put the Grand Canyon into the palm of your hand. Using augmented reality on tablets or phones, students trace the path of a scaled virtual rafting trip down the Grand Canyon, learning about geologic time, geologic structures, or hydrology. The project assessed both student learning and enjoyment. &nbsp;Development of spatially-referenced, mobile-device software applications for geoscience education using the Colorado Plateau as a virtual classroom, National Science Foundation, EHR $240,737.

                                <p class="c0"><span class="c2">This project focuses on the use of scaffolding in STEM learning in formal and informal setting. Andrew Walker, who is interested in Problem-Based Pedagogy and meta-analysis, partnered with Brian Beland, who is interested in scaffold education. The researchers used meta-analysis to determine the impact of scaffolding on cognitive outcomes. They found that scaffolding is very helpful in preparing all students to address fundamental STEM problems. They also found that fading, which is often synonymous with scaffolding, doesn&rsquo;t have the strongest learning outcomes. </span></p>
